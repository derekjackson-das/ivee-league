# Ivee League Wedding Photography — demo site

A clickable demo website for a fictional wedding photography studio in Cambridge, Massachusetts. It shows how a small studio site can attract couples, show the work, and turn visitors into qualified inquiries while meeting WCAG 2.2 AA on a photo-heavy site.

**This is a demo site. Ivee League Wedding Photography is fictional.** No real bookings, payments, or client data. Testimonials, prices, and dates are samples.

## What's here

- Static site in plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No framework, no build step.
- Pages: Home, Portfolio, About, Packages, Cost Calculator, FAQ, Inquiry (with date checker), Accessibility Statement.
- Sample booked dates and price rules live in `data/` so they're easy to change.
- Hosted on GitHub Pages.
